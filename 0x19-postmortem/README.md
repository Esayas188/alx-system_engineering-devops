Postmortem: Web Stack Outage

Issue Summary:
Duration: August 10, 2023, 08:00 AM - August 11, 2023, 04:00 PM (UTC)
Impact: The user authentication service experienced a complete outage, affecting all users. Users were unable to log in or access any authenticated features during the entire duration of the outage.

Timeline:

- Issue Detected: August 10, 2023, 08:00 AM (UTC)
- Detection Method: An engineer noticed an unusually high number of failed login attempts in the system logs.
- Actions Taken: The investigation initially focused on the authentication server and database. It was assumed that an issue with the database connectivity might be causing the authentication failures.
- Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths: The team spent several hours examining the database logs and network connectivity, but no issues were found. The focus on the database caused delays in identifying the actual root cause.
- Escalation: The incident was escalated to the senior development team and the infrastructure team for further investigation and coordination.
- Incident Resolution: After extensive analysis, it was discovered that a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused all incoming requests to bypass the authentication server, resulting in authentication failures for all users.

Root Cause and Resolution:

- Root Cause: The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused the requests to bypass the authentication server.
- Resolution: The load balancer settings were corrected to ensure that all requests were properly routed to the authentication server. Additionally, comprehensive tests were implemented to verify the load balancer's configuration integrity.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

- Improvements/Fixes:
  1. Enhance monitoring and alerting: Implement more granular monitoring for critical services, specifically targeting authentication-related components.
  1. Load balancer configuration review: Conduct periodic audits of load balancer configurations to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.
  1. Incident response training: Provide additional training to the team to improve incident response processes and ensure timely escalation and collaboration.
- Tasks to Address the Issue:
  1. Patch load balancer configuration: Apply the corrected load balancer configuration across all environments.
  1. Review monitoring setup: Enhance monitoring by implementing threshold-based alerts for authentication-related failures.
  1. Conduct load balancer configuration audit: Perform a comprehensive review of all load balancer configurations to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations.
  1. Incident response drills: Organize regular incident response drills to practice and refine the team's response to critical issues.

In conclusion, the web stack outage was caused by a misconfigured load balancer that bypassed the authentication server, resulting in a complete authentication service outage for all users. The issue was resolved by correcting the load balancer settings and implementing additional monitoring and auditing measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. The incident highlighted the importance of comprehensive monitoring, timely investigation, and effective collaboration to minimize the impact of outages on user experience.
